"""
This solution beat 83% of other solutions.

Given a string s, return the number of palindromic substrings in it.
A string is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

Example 1:

Input: s = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c".
Example 2:

Input: s = "aaa"
Output: 6
Explanation: Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 1000
s consists of lowercase English letters.
